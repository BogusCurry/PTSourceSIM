# Introduction to Virtual Worlds

A virtual world or massively multiplayer online world (MMOW) is a computer-based simulated environment populated by many users who can create a personal avatar, and simultaneously and independently explore and build the virtual world, participate in its activities and communicate with others. These avatars can be textual, two or three-dimensional graphical representations, or live video avatars with auditory and touch sensations. In general, virtual worlds allow for multiple users.

# PTSourceSIM

PTSourceSIM is an server and client platform for hosting virtual worlds and the Metaverse. PTSourceSIM also uses an architecture known as "Hypergrid", which allows users to teleport between multiple virtual worlds by providing a hyperlinked map which indexes public grids.  PTSourceSIM allows you to have and build your 3d virtual world out of the box. It already comes pre configured and ready to start buliding. Also you can share your world with others that can enter your 3d virtual world.
